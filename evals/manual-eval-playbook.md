# Manual RAG Eval Playbook

A step-by-step process to evaluate PM Compass search quality by hand using the product UI and a Google Sheet. Complements the automated harness (`run-evals.ts`) with qualitative insight into retrieval and synthesis quality.

**Why manual eval?**
- Builds intuition about what good/bad retrieval looks like
- Spots failure modes aggregate numbers hide (right doc, wrong section; hallucinated facts)
- No env vars, no CLI — just the product + a spreadsheet
- Great learning exercise for understanding RAG eval fundamentals

## 1. Google Sheet Setup

Create a Google Sheet with 4 tabs: **Query Reference**, **Results**, **Metrics**, **Comparison**.

### Tab 1: Query Reference

Pre-populated lookup table. No manual entry needed — copy-paste from the query table below.

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| A: Query ID | q01 – q50 |
| B: Query Text | The search query to type into PM Compass |
| C: Category | exact_lookup, factual_extraction, tabular_statistical, paraphrase, cross_document, negative, vague_broad |
| D: Difficulty | easy, medium, hard |
| E: Expected Doc 1 | Symbolic name (e.g., ROADMAP_2025) |
| F: Expected Doc 2 | (blank if only 1 expected) |
| G: Expected Doc 3 | (blank if <3 expected) |
| H: Expected Doc 4 | (blank if <4 expected) |
| I: # Expected Docs | Count of expected docs |
| J: Expected Phrase 1 | First phrase to look for in answer |
| K: Expected Phrase 2 | Second phrase |
| L: Expected Phrase 3 | Third phrase |
| M: # Expected Phrases | Count of expected phrases |
| N: Notes | What this query tests |

### Tab 2: Results

Where you record what PM Compass returns.

| Column | Content | How to Fill |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| A: Query ID | `='Query Reference'!A2` | Auto-filled (drag down) |
| B: Query Text | `='Query Reference'!B2` | Auto-filled |
| C: Result 1 Title | Title of 1st source doc returned | Copy from PM Compass UI |
| D: Result 1 Match? | Is this doc in the expected list? | Type `Y` or `N` |
| E: Result 2 Title | Title of 2nd source doc | Copy from UI |
| F: Result 2 Match? | Y/N | Manual |
| G: Result 3 Title | Title of 3rd source doc | Copy from UI |
| H: Result 3 Match? | Y/N | Manual |
| I: Result 4 Title | Title of 4th source doc | Copy from UI |
| J: Result 4 Match? | Y/N | Manual |
| K: Result 5 Title | Title of 5th source doc | Copy from UI |
| L: Result 5 Match? | Y/N | Manual |
| M: # Results Returned | How many source docs shown | Count from UI |
| N: Answer Text | The AI-synthesized answer | Copy-paste from UI |
| O: Phrase 1 Found? | Does answer contain expected phrase 1? | Y/N (Ctrl+F in the answer) |
| P: Phrase 2 Found? | Y/N | Manual |
| Q: Phrase 3 Found? | Y/N | Manual |
| R: Qualitative Notes | Anything you notice | Free text |

### Tab 3: Metrics

Auto-computed from Results and Query Reference tabs. All formulas reference row 2 — drag down to row 51.

| Column | Header | Formula (row 2) |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| A | Query ID | `=Results!A2` |
| B | Category | `='Query Reference'!C2` |
| C | Difficulty | `='Query Reference'!D2` |
| D | Recall@5 | `=IF('Query Reference'!I2=0, 1, COUNTIF(Results!D2,"Y",Results!F2,"Y",Results!H2,"Y",Results!J2,"Y",Results!L2,"Y") / 'Query Reference'!I2)` |
| E | Precision@5 | `=IF('Query Reference'!I2=0, IF(Results!M2=0, 1, 0), COUNTIF(Results!D2,"Y",Results!F2,"Y",Results!H2,"Y",Results!J2,"Y",Results!L2,"Y") / MAX(Results!M2, 1))` |
| F | Reciprocal Rank | See formula below |
| G | Factual Containment | `=IF('Query Reference'!M2=0, 1, COUNTIF(Results!O2,"Y",Results!P2,"Y",Results!Q2,"Y") / 'Query Reference'!M2)` |
| H | Citation Accuracy | `=D2` (same as Recall@5 in this setup) |

**COUNTIF note:** Google Sheets `COUNTIF` only takes one range. Use this instead:

```
=COUNTIFS(Results!D2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!F2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!H2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!J2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!L2,"Y")
```

So the actual **Recall@5** formula for row 2 is:
```
=IF('Query Reference'!I2=0, 1,
  (COUNTIFS(Results!D2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!F2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!H2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!J2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!L2,"Y"))
  / 'Query Reference'!I2)
```

**Precision@5** formula:
```
=IF('Query Reference'!I2=0,
  IF(Results!M2=0, 1, 0),
  (COUNTIFS(Results!D2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!F2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!H2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!J2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!L2,"Y"))
  / MAX(Results!M2, 1))
```

**Factual Containment** formula:
```
=IF('Query Reference'!M2=0, 1,
  (COUNTIFS(Results!O2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!P2,"Y") + COUNTIFS(Results!Q2,"Y"))
  / 'Query Reference'!M2)
```

**Reciprocal Rank** formula:
```
=IF(Results!D2="Y", 1,
  IF(Results!F2="Y", 0.5,
    IF(Results!H2="Y", 1/3,
      IF(Results!J2="Y", 0.25,
        IF(Results!L2="Y", 0.2, 0)))))
```

#### Aggregate Metrics (row 52)

```
Avg Recall@5:            =AVERAGE(D2:D51)
Avg Precision@5:         =AVERAGE(E2:E51)
MRR:                     =AVERAGE(F2:F51)
Avg Factual Containment: =AVERAGE(G2:G51)
Avg Citation Accuracy:   =AVERAGE(H2:H51)
```

#### By-Category Averages (rows 54-60)

```
exact_lookup Recall@5:         =AVERAGEIF(B2:B51, "exact_lookup", D2:D51)
factual_extraction Recall@5:   =AVERAGEIF(B2:B51, "factual_extraction", D2:D51)
tabular_statistical Recall@5:  =AVERAGEIF(B2:B51, "tabular_statistical", D2:D51)
paraphrase Recall@5:           =AVERAGEIF(B2:B51, "paraphrase", D2:D51)
cross_document Recall@5:       =AVERAGEIF(B2:B51, "cross_document", D2:D51)
negative Recall@5:             =AVERAGEIF(B2:B51, "negative", D2:D51)
vague_broad Recall@5:          =AVERAGEIF(B2:B51, "vague_broad", D2:D51)
```

Replace column `D` with `G` for Factual Containment by category. Same pattern for other metrics.

#### By-Difficulty Averages (rows 62-64)

```
easy Recall@5:    =AVERAGEIF(C2:C51, "easy", D2:D51)
medium Recall@5:  =AVERAGEIF(C2:C51, "medium", D2:D51)
hard Recall@5:    =AVERAGEIF(C2:C51, "hard", D2:D51)
```

### Tab 4: Comparison

| Row | A: Metric | B: Manual Result | C: Automated Baseline | D: Delta |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|
| 2 | Recall@5 | `=Metrics!D52` | 0.833 | `=B2-C2` |
| 3 | Precision@5 | `=Metrics!E52` | 0.264 | `=B3-C3` |
| 4 | MRR | `=Metrics!F52` | 0.768 | `=B4-C4` |

## 4. Step-by-Step Recording Process

### For Each Query

1. Go to **productcompass-puce.vercel.app** → sign in → Search page
2. **Copy-paste** the query exactly as written from Tab 1 column B
3. Wait for results to load
4. In the **Results** tab, record:
   - Titles of the source documents shown (in order, up to 5)
   - For each doc: mark `Y` if it matches any expected doc in Tab 1, `N` otherwise
   - Copy the full AI-synthesized answer text
   - For each expected phrase: Ctrl+F / Cmd+F in the answer, mark `Y` or `N`
5. (Optional) Add qualitative notes in column R:
   - "Answer was good but missed the pricing detail"
   - "Returned right doc but summarized wrong section"
   - "Hallucinated a number not in any source"
   - "Said 'I don't have information' — correct for negative query"

### After All Queries

1. Switch to **Tab 3 (Metrics)** — formulas compute everything automatically
2. Review the **aggregate row** (row 52) for overall scores
3. Check **by-category** and **by-difficulty** breakdowns
4. Go to **Tab 4 (Comparison)** to see delta vs. automated baseline
5. Sort by Recall@5 ascending to find the worst-performing queries

---

## 5. Negative Query Handling

For negative queries (q39-q43), the expected doc list is empty. Scoring rules:

| Metric | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Recall@5 | Always 1.0 (nothing to miss) |
| Precision@5 | 1.0 if system returns 0 results, 0.0 if it returns anything |
| Factual Containment | Always 1.0 (no phrases expected) |

**What to watch for manually:**
- Does the answer say "I don't have information about this"? → Good
- Does it hallucinate an answer from tangentially related docs? → Bad, note it
- Does it return source docs that aren't relevant? → Note which ones

---

## 6. Interpreting Results

### What Good Looks Like

| Metric | Good | Acceptable | Needs Work |
|--------|------|-----------|------------|
| Recall@5 | >90% | 75-90% | <75% |
| Precision@5 | >30% | 20-30% | <20% |
| MRR | >80% | 60-80% | <60% |
| Factual Containment | >70% | 50-70% | <50% |

### Common Failure Patterns

| Pattern | What You See | Likely Cause |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Right doc, wrong rank | Expected doc at position 3-5, not 1 | Embedding similarity not differentiating well |
| Right doc, wrong answer | Correct source but answer misses key fact | Chunk boundary split the relevant info |
| Wrong doc, plausible answer | Unrelated doc but answer sounds reasonable | Hallucination — model is confabulating |
| No results for valid query | "I don't have information" for a query that should match | Query phrasing too different from doc language |
| Too many results for negative | Returns 5 docs for a query about nonexistent topic | Threshold too low (currently 0.3) |

### Manual vs. Automated Delta

| Delta | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| Manual ≈ Automated (±5%) | System is consistent — UI matches backend |
| Manual < Automated | UI might truncate results, or you're stricter on matching |
| Manual > Automated | You're more generous on matching, or automated has a bug |

---

## 7. Automated Baseline Reference

From run `baseline-2026-03-06T20-27-04`:

```
Overall:
  Recall@5:            83.3%
  Precision@5:         26.4%
  MRR:                 76.8%
  Factual Containment: 55.3%
  Citation Accuracy:   76.0%

By Category:
  exact_lookup           R@5=100%   FC=100%
  factual_extraction     R@5=89%    FC=64%
  tabular_statistical    R@5=85%    FC=50%
  paraphrase             R@5=83%    FC=20%
  cross_document         R@5=74%    FC=22%
  negative               R@5=100%   FC=100%
  vague_broad            R@5=47%    FC=40%

By Difficulty:
  easy                   R@5=100%   FC=90%
  medium                 R@5=85%    FC=54%
  hard                   R@5=64%    FC=29%
```
